                            <h3>Getting Started with 3D Modeling: My First Project</h3>
                            <p class="excerpt">When I first opened my 3D modeling software, I was overwhelmed by the sheer number of tools and options. But after watching a few tutorials, I decided to start small—a simple coffee mug. The process of creating basic shapes and extruding them into something tangible was oddly satisfying. It wasn’t perfect (the handle looked a bit wonky), but it was my creation. That small victory fueled my curiosity, and I realized 3D modeling is as much about patience as it is creativity. If you’re thinking of trying it, just dive in—mistakes are part of the journey!</p>

                            <p class="excerpt">Sculpting organic shapes in 3D modeling feels like digital clay work, but trust me, it’s not as easy as it sounds! My recent attempt at creating a human face proved that. Getting the proportions right while adding subtle details like wrinkles and muscle structure was a true test of patience. I spent hours tweaking the nose and cheeks, and yet, something still looked slightly off. Despite the frustration, the process taught me to observe real-world references closely. Every failed attempt is a step closer to mastering the craft. It’s a humbling but rewarding experience.</p>

                            <h3>Bringing 3D Models to Life with Texturing</h3>
                            <p class="excerpt">After finishing the shape of my model, the next big task was texturing. I recently worked on a wooden treasure chest, and adding textures transformed it from a basic shape to something almost lifelike. Choosing the right grain for the wood and creating a metallic look for the hinges involved a mix of procedural and hand-painted techniques. Seeing how light interacts with the textures I applied gave the model a whole new level of realism. It’s amazing how much textures can elevate a design. I’m excited to explore more advanced techniques like normal mapping and displacement next!</p>
